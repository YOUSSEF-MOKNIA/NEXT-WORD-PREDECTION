# Next Word Prediction with Deep Learning

Hey there! Welcome to the Next Word Prediction project. This repo is all about creating a cool deep learning model that can predict the next word in a sequence of text. Perfect for making your own text predictor like the ones on your smartphone keyboards!

## What's This All About?
Next Word Prediction is a fun and useful task in natural language processing. It's used in messaging apps, search engines, virtual assistants, and more. In this project, we use a neural network to guess what word comes next in a sentence.

## How It Works
- **Get the Data:** We use a dataset with text from Sherlock Holmes stories. You can find it in the Dataset folder.
- **Preprocess the Data:** Clean up the text, tokenize it, and create sequences of words.
- **Build the Model:** We use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for this task.
- **Train the Model:** Feed it the data and let it learn.
- **Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to predict the next word.
